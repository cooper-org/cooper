        Structuring the CMP class around this closure method, enables the re-use
        of shared sections of a computational graph. For example, consider a
        case where we want to minimize a model's cross entropy loss subject to
        a constraint on the entropy of its predictions. Both of these quantities
        depend on the predicted logits (on a minibatch). This closure-centric
