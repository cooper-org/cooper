        other arguments to be passed.

        Structuring the CMP class around this closure method, enables the re-use
        of shared sections of a computational graph. For example, consider a
        case where we want to minimize a model's cross entropy loss subject to
        a constraint on the entropy of its predictions. Both of these quantities
        depend on the predicted logits (on a minibatch). This closure-centric
        design allows flexible problem specifications while avoiding
        re-computation.

        have a ``loss`` attribute with value ``None`` since, by design, the loss
