## Formulation

TODO: move somewhere else?

Formulations denote mathematical or algorithmic techniques aimed at solving a
specific (family of) CMP. **Cooper** is heavily (but not exclusively!) designed
for an easy integration of Lagrangian-based formulations. You can find more
details in {doc}`lagrangian_formulation`.
