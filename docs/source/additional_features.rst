Additional features
-------------------

In this section we provide details on using "advanced features" such as
alternating updates, the Augmented Lagrangian method or dual restarts, in
conjunction with a
:py:class:`~cooper.constrained_optimizer.ConstrainedOptimizer`.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. _alternating_updates:

Alternating updates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is possible to perform alternating updates between the primal and dual
parameters by setting the flag ``alternating=True`` in the construction of the
:py:class:`ConstrainedOptimizer`. In this case, the gradient computed by calling
:py:meth:`~cooper.problem.Formulation.custom_backward` is used to update the
primal parameters. Then, the gradient with respect to the dual variables (given
the new value of the primal parameters!) is computed and used to update the dual
variables. This two-stage process is handled by **Cooper** inside the
:py:meth:`ConstrainedOptimizer.step` method.

.. math::

    x_{t+1} &= \texttt{primal_optimizers_update} \left( x_{t}, \nabla_{x} \mathcal{L}_{c_t}(x, \lambda_t)|_{x=x_t} \right)\\
    \lambda_{t+1} &= \texttt{dual_optimizer_update} \left( \lambda_{t}, {\color{red} \mathbf{-}} \nabla_{\lambda} \mathcal{L}({\color{red} x_{t+1}}, \lambda)|_{\lambda=\lambda_t} \right)


.. important::

    Selecting ``alternating=True`` does not necessarily double the number of
    backward passes through a the primal parameters!

    When using a ``LagrangianFormulation``, to obtain the gradients with respect
    to the Lagrange multipliers, it suffices to *evaluate* the constraint
    defects (through a call to
    :py:meth:`~cooper.problem.ConstrainedMinimizationProblem.closure`). This
    operation does not require a having to back-propagate through the Lagrangian
    with respect to the primal parameters.

    Providing a ``defect_fn`` in the call to :py:meth:`ConstrainedOptimizer.step`
    allows for updating the Lagrange multiplier without having to re-evaluate
    the loss function, but rather only the constraints.

.. warning::

    Combining alternating updates with :ref:`dual restarts<dual_restarts>` is untested. Use at your
    own risk.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. _augmented_lagrangian_const_opt:

Augmented Lagrangian method
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Exactly solving the intermediate optimization problems considered by the
:ref:`Augmented Lagrangian formulation<augmented_lagrangian_formulation>` can
be challenging. This is particularly true when :math:`L_{c_t}(x, \lambda)` is
non-convex in :math:`x`.

Rather than aiming to solve the intermediate optimization problem to high
precision, **Cooper** implements a version of the Augmented Lagrangian method
where the primal variables are updated using a gradient-based step.

.. math::
    x_{t+1} = \texttt{primal_optimizers_update} \left( x_{t}, \nabla_{x} \mathcal{L}_{c_t}(x, \lambda_t)|_{x=x_t} \right)

The new primal variables are then used to perform an
:ref:`alternating update<alternating_updates>` on the Lagrange multipliers.

Augmented Lagrangian coefficients
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Recall that the update for the dual variables in an
:ref:`Augmented Lagrangian formulation<augmented_lagrangian_formulation>` is:

.. math::
    \lambda_{g, t+1} &= \left[\lambda_{g, t} + c_t g(x_{t+1}) \right]^+ \\
    \lambda_{h, t+1} &= \lambda_{h, t} + c_t h(x_{t+1})

This corresponds exactly to a (projected) gradient ascent update on the dual
variables with "step size" :math:`c_t` on the function:

.. math::
    \mathcal{L}_{c_t}(x_{t+1}, \lambda) \triangleq &  \, \, {\color{gray} \overbrace{ f(x_{t+1}) +\frac{c_t}{2} ||g(x_{t+1}) \odot \mathbf{1}_{g(x_{t+1}) \ge 0 \vee \lambda_{g} > 0}||^2 +  \frac{c_t}{2} ||h(x_{t+1})||^2}^{\text{do not contribute to gradient } \nabla_{\lambda} \mathcal{L}(x_{t+1}, \lambda)|_{\lambda = \lambda_t}}} \\
    &  \, \, +  \lambda_{g}^{\top} \, g(x_{t+1}) + \lambda_{h}^{\top} \, h(x_{t+1})

Therefore, the sequence of Augmented Lagrangian coefficients can be identified
with a :ref:`scheduler on the dual learning rate<dual_lr_scheduler>`.

.. math::
    \lambda_{t+1} = \texttt{dual_optimizer_update} \left( \lambda_{t}, {\color{red} \mathbf{-}} \nabla_{\lambda} \mathcal{L}({\color{red} x_{t+1}}, \lambda_t) , \texttt{lr} = c_t\right)


As in the :ref:`default parameter updates<basic_parameter_updates>`, we
explicitly include a negative sign in front of the dual gradient to denote the
`maximization` performed in the dual variables, since Pytorch optimizers use a
minimization convention. **Cooper** handles the gradient sign flip internally.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:
    :emphasize-lines: 19, 20, 23, 31, 47, 58

    params = torch.nn.Parameter(...)
    primal_optimizer = torch.optim.SGD([params], lr=1e-2)

    # Set the dual_optimizer base learning rate to 1.0 since the penalty coefficient
    # for the Augmented Lagrangian is controlled via the dual scheduler
    dual_optimizer = cooper.optim.partial_optimizer(torch.optim.SGD, lr=1.0)

    # Increasing Augmented Lagrangian coefficient schedule
    dual_scheduler = cooper.optim.partial_scheduler(
        torch.optim.lr_scheduler.LambdaLR, lr_lambda=lambda step: math.sqrt(step / 100)

    )

    # We need to manually trigger the creation of the Lagrange multipliers (formulation state)
    # and the link them to the dual optimizer.

    # we need it to compute the Augmented Lagrangian coefficient.
    formulation.create_state_from_metadata(
        dtype=params.dtype, device=device, ineq_size=torch.Size([3]), eq_size=torch.Size([4])
    )
    coop.instantiate_dual_optimizer_and_scheduler()

    for step_id in range(1000):
        coop.zero_grad()

        lagrangian = formulation.composite_objective(
            aug_lag_coeff_scheduler=coop.dual_scheduler,
            closure=cmp.closure,
            params=params,
        )
        formulation.custom_backward(lagrangian)

        # We need to pass the closure or defect_fn to perform the alternating updates
        # required by the Augmented Lagrangian method.
        coop.step(defect_fn=cmp.defect_fn, params=params) # Or: closure=cmp.closure

        # Remember that you need to call the dual_scheduler manually!
        coop.dual_scheduler.step()

.. _dual_restarts:

Dual restarts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``dual_restarts=True`` can be used to set the value of the dual variables
associated with inequality constraints to zero whenever the respective
constraints are being satisfied. We do not perform ``dual_restarts`` on
multipliers for equality constraints.

For simplicity, consider a CMP with two inequality constraints
:math:`g_1(x) \le 0` and :math:`g_2(x) \le 0` and loss :math:`f(x)`. Suppose
that the constraint on :math:`g_1` is strictly satisfied, while that on
:math:`g_2` is violated at :math:`x`. Consider the Lagrangian at :math:`x`
with (**non-negative**) multipliers :math:`\lambda_1` and :math:`\lambda_2`.

.. math::
    \mathcal{L}(x,\lambda_1, \lambda_2) = f(x) + \lambda_1 \, g_1(x) + \lambda_2 \, g_2(x)

The `best response <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_response>`_ for
:math:`\lambda_1` and :math:`\lambda_2` at the current value of the primal
parameters :math:`x` is :math:`(\lambda_1, \lambda_2) = (0, +\infty)`. This is
due to the non-negativity constraints on the Lagrange multipliers, the sign of
the constraint violations, and the fact that the :math:`\lambda`-player wants to
maximize :math:`\mathcal{L}(x,\lambda_1, \lambda_2)`.

"Playing a best response" for the Lagrange multiplier :math:`\lambda_2` of the
violated constraint clearly leads to an impractical algorithm (due to numerical
overflow). However, for the currently *feasible* constraint, performing a best
response update on :math:`\lambda_1` is indeed implementable, and trivially so.
This is exactly the effect of setting ``dual_restarts=True``!

In practice, this prevents the optimization from over-focusing on a constraint
(at the expense on improving on the loss function!) when said constraint **is
already being satisfied**. This over-penalization arises from the accumulation
of the (positive) defects in the value of the Lagrange multiplier while the
constraint was being violated in the past.

.. note::
    We recommend setting ``dual_restarts=False`` when dealing with constraints
    whose violations are estimated stochastically, for example Monte Carlo
    estimates constraints described by expectations.  This is to avoid
    restarting multipliers when a constraint is "being satisfied" for a single
    estimate, since this can be a result of the stochasticity of the estimator.


.. warning::
    The behavior of dual restarts has only been tested using
    :py:class:`~cooper.DenseMultiplier` objects.


.. _multiple-primal_optimizers:

Multiple primal optimizers
--------------------------

When constructing a :py:class:`~cooper.constrained_optimizer.ConstrainedOptimizer`,
one or multiple primal optimizers (grouped in a list) can be provided. Allowing 
for multiple primal optimizers is useful when setting separate groups of primal 
variables to have different optimizer classes and hyperparameters.

When a list of optimizers is provided for the ``primal_optimizers`` argument, they are
treated "as if they were a single optimizer". In particular, all primal optimizers 
operations such as :py:meth:`optimizer.step()<torch.optim.Optimizer.step>` are 
executed simultaneously (without intermediate calls to
:py:meth:`cmp.closure()<cooper.problem.ConstrainedMinimizationProblem.closure>` or
:py:meth:`formulation.custom_backward(lagrangian)<cooper.problem.Formulation.custom_backward>`).
