# Constrained Minimization Problems

We consider constrained minimization problems (CMPs) of the form:

$$
\min_{\vx \in \reals^d} & \,\, f(\vx) \\ \text{s.t. }
& \,\, \vg(\vx) \le \vzero \\ & \,\, \vh(\vx) = \vzero
$$

See {ref}`here<overview>` for a brief introduction to constrained optimization. In this section, we will discuss how to represent CMPs using **Cooper**. To do this, consider the following objects:
- {py:class}`~cooper.constraints.Constraint`: represents a group of either equality or inequality constraints.
- {py:class}`~cooper.ConstrainedMinimizationProblem`: represents the constrained minimization problem itself. It must include a method {py:meth}`~cooper.ConstrainedMinimizationProblem.compute_cmp_state` that computes the loss and constraint violations at a given point.

Moreover, in order to package the values of the loss and constraints, we will define the following objects:
- {py:class}`~cooper.constraints.ConstraintState`: contains the value of the constraint violation at the given iterate.
- {py:class}`~cooper.CMPState`: contains the values of the loss and {py:class}`~cooper.constraints.ConstraintState` objects for (some or all of) its associated constraints.

## Example

The example below illustrates the required steps for defining a {py:class}`~cooper.ConstrainedMinimizationProblem` class for your problem. For simplicity, we illustrate the case of a single (possibly multi-dimensional) inequality constraint.
1. **\[Line 4\]** Define a custom class which inherits from {py:class}`~cooper.ConstrainedMinimizationProblem`.
2. **\[Line 7\]** Instantiate a multiplier object for the constraint.
3. **\[Lines 9-11\]** Define the constraint object, specifying the constraint type and (optionally) the formulation type.
4. **\[Line 13\]** Implement the {py:meth}`~cooper.ConstrainedMinimizationProblem.compute_cmp_state` method that evaluates the loss and constraints.
5. **\[Line 18\]** Return the information about the loss and constraints packaged into a {py:class}`~cooper.CMPState`.
6. **\[Line 20\]** (Optional) Modularize the code to allow for evaluating the constraints **only**. This is useful for optimization algorithms that sometimes need to evaluate the constraints without computing the loss.

```{code-block} python
:emphasize-lines: 4, 7, 9-11, 13, 18, 20
:linenos: true

import torch
import cooper

class MyCMP(cooper.ConstrainedMinimizationProblem):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        multiplier = cooper.multipliers.DenseMultiplier(num_constraints=..., device=...)
        # By default, constraints are built using `formulation_type=cooper.formulations.Lagrangian`
        self.constraint = cooper.Constraint(
            multiplier=multiplier, constraint_type=cooper.ConstraintType.INEQUALITY
        )

    def compute_cmp_state(self, model, inputs, targets):
        loss = ...
        cmp_state = self.compute_violations(model, inputs, targets)
        cmp_state.loss = loss

        return cmp_state

    def compute_violations(self, model, inputs, targets):
        # This method is optional. It allows for evaluating the constraints without
        # computing the loss.
        violation = ... # ensure that the constraint follows the convention "g <= 0"
        constraint_state = cooper.ConstraintState(violation=...)
        observed_constraints = {self.constraint: constraint_state}

        return cooper.CMPState(loss=None, observed_constraints=observed_constraints)
```

## Loss

The {py:class}`~cooper.CMPState` dataclass includes the loss, which must be a scalar `torch.Tensor` representing $f(\vx)$, and is used to update the primal variables in the optimization. For feasibility problems, where only constraint satisfaction matters, the loss should be set to `None`.

## Constraints

{py:class}`~cooper.constraints.Constraint` objects are used to group similar constraints together. While it is possible to have multiple constraints represented by the same {py:class}`~cooper.constraints.Constraint` object, they must share the same type (i.e., all equality or all inequality constraints) and all must be handled through the same {py:class}`~cooper.formulations.Formulation` (for example, a {py:class}`~cooper.formulations.Lagrangian`). For problems with different types of constraints or formulations, you should instantiate separate {py:class}`~cooper.constraints.Constraint` objects.

Constraints can be defined as either equality or inequality. This is done using the {py:class}`~cooper.ConstraintType` class.

```{eval-rst}
.. autoclass:: cooper.ConstraintType
    :members:
```

To construct the constraint, instantiate a {py:class}`~cooper.multipliers.Multiplier` object. The {py:class}`~cooper.constraints.Constraint` will be associated to this multiplier, and the observed constraint values will be used to update the multiplier. For more details on multiplier objects, see {doc}`multipliers`.


```{eval-rst}
.. currentmodule:: cooper.constraints
```

```{eval-rst}
.. autoclass:: Constraint
```

## ConstraintStates

In their simplest form, {py:class}`~cooper.constraints.ConstraintState` objects contain the value of the constraint violation. However, they can be extended to enable extra functionality, such as constraint sampling, the use of implicit parameterizations for the Lagrange multipliers {cite:p}`narasimhan2020multiplier`, and proxy constraints {cite:p}`cotter2019proxy`.

### Constraint Sampling

**Cooper** can handle cases where only a subset of {py:class}`Constraint` violations are observed at each step.
For instance, in problems with a large number of constraints, where assessing feasibility is costly (e.g., requiring evaluation across an entire dataset), it can be more efficient to evaluate only a subset of constraints per iteration.
To do this, specify the subset of observed constraint violations and ensure that an {py:class}`~cooper.multipliers.IndexedMultiplier` is used as the multiplier associated with the constraint.

Consider the case of an $n$-dimensional constraint, where only $m \leq n$ entries are observed. **Cooper** expects the following arguments when instantiating a {py:class}`ConstraintState`:

1. `violation` should be an $m$-dimensional tensor containing only the *observed* violations.
2. `constraint_features` should contain the indices corresponding to the observed entries in `violation`. Note that permutations are allowed, as long as the ordering of `violation` and `constraint_features` is consistent.
3. If provided, `strict_violation` and `strict_constraint_features` should follow the same pattern.

This setup allows **Cooper** to selectively account for the specified constraint entries when calculating contributions to the Lagrangian, ignoring those that are not observed. More details on indexed multipliers can be found in the section on {doc}`multipliers`.

### Implicit Parameterization of Lagrange Multipliers {cite:p}`narasimhan2020multiplier`


**Cooper** enables implicit parameterization of the Lagrange multipliers, for example, by using a neural network.
This allows **Cooper** to compute multipliers based on specified input features and to learn a parametric model for the multipliers, rather than defining them individually for each constraint.
This approach helps scale the Lagrangian approach to problems with numerous (or even infinite) constraints.

To achieve this, follow these steps:

1. Implement a Lagrange multiplier model by inheriting from {py:class}`~cooper.multipliers.ImplicitMultiplier`.
Given input features for a constraint, the model will map the input features to an estimate of the Lagrange multiplier for that constraint.
2. Pass these input features as the `constraint_features` in the {py:class}`ConstraintState` object.

For additional details, refer to {doc}`multipliers`.

### Proxy Constraints {cite:p}`cotter2019proxy`

It is often the case that constrained optimization problems involve non-differentiable constraints. This non-differentiability precludes the use of gradient-based primal-dual optimization methods.
The **proxy constraints** technique introduced by {cite:t}`cotter2019proxy` leverages a differentiable surrogate of the constraint when performing the primal updates, while preserving the original (non-differentiable) constraint for updating the dual variables (see {ref}`here<proxy>` for details).

To use proxy constraints in **Cooper**:

1. Specify `violation` for updating the **primal variables**. Ensure that this `violation` is differentiable with respect to the primal variables.
2. Provide (the potentially non-differentiable) `strict_violation` for updating the **dual variables**.

Proxy constraints can be combined with sampled constraints and implicit multipliers. To do so, include both `constraint_features` and `strict_constraint_features` as needed.


```{eval-rst}
.. autoclass:: ConstraintState
```


## CMPs

```{eval-rst}
.. currentmodule:: cooper
```

{py:class}`ConstrainedMinimizationProblem` (CMP) objects must be implemented by the user, as shown in the [example](#example) above.

CMPs represent constrained optimization problems and provide methods to compute the problemâ€™s state, {py:class}`CMPState`, which includes the loss and constraints at a given point. The methods to be implemented are {py:meth}`~ConstrainedMinimizationProblem.compute_cmp_state` and, optionally, {py:meth}`~ConstrainedMinimizationProblem.compute_violations`.

Additionally, CMPs serve as an interface between the user and **Cooper**, enabling access to constraints, multipliers, and penalty coefficients via methods such as {py:meth}`~ConstrainedMinimizationProblem.constraints`, {py:meth}`~ConstrainedMinimizationProblem.multipliers`, and {py:meth}`~ConstrainedMinimizationProblem.penalty_coefficients`.


```{eval-rst}
.. autoclass:: ConstrainedMinimizationProblem
    :members:
```

## CMPStates

We represent the computational "state" of a CMP using a {py:class}`CMPState` object. A {py:class}`CMPState` is a dataclass containing the information about the loss and constraint violations measured at a specific point. The constraints included in the {py:class}`CMPState` must be passed as a dictionary, where the keys are the {py:class}`Constraint` objects and the values are the associated {py:class}`ConstraintState` objects.


:::{note}
To ensure that your {py:class}`CMPState` is correctly constructedâ€”with loss and constraint tensors that have gradientsâ€”you can use the {py:meth}`ConstrainedMinimizationProblem.sanity_check_cmp_state` method.
